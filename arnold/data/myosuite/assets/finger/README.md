# MyoFinger 0.1

## General:

The myoFinger mujoco musculoskeletal (MSK) model was created based on a biomimetic artificial robotic finger system [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6290710].

It is a simplified and intuitive model of a 4 Degree of Freedom (DoF) finger (MyoFinger, Figure 4A), which is actuated through a series of 5 simplified antagonistic muscle-tendon units.

## Maunal adjustment:
- Adjustments post conversion to optimize for kitnematic and dynamic behaviors
- Inertial properties
- Dynamics properties of the joints

## Contact Geometries:
- Manually designed with references
- Contact properties optimized for contact rich behaviors

## Issues:
- N/A
